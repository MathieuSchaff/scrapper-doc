# How does the frontend work?

The frontend was bootstrapped with Next.js. Next.js is a framework for building React applications with server-side rendering and other powerful features. You can learn more about Next.js in the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## Installation:


Move to the backend folder:

```shell
cd frontend
```

```shell
npm i
```

```shell
npm start 
```

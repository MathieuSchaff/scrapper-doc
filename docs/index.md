# Prerequisites

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started): Docker is used to containerize the application and its dependencies.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/): Docker Compose is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime required to run the project.

I won't go in details on how installing Docker. Feel free to do your own research,
because the installation process can be very different depending on the OS. 


## Installation

1. Install Docker by following the instructions provided in the [official Docker documentation](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. Install Docker Compose by following the instructions provided in the [official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

3. Install Node.js by downloading the installer appropriate for your operating system from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and following the installation instructions.

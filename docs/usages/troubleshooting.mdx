# Troubleshooting 

## How to understand the problem? 

Most of the times it will be a problem of css selectors that we are trying to access but don't exists.
go in the backend folder.

There is a chance that the selectors used to get the dom elements are obsolete. 

This can be check by running 
```bash
npx playwright tests
```
or 

```bash
npx playwright tests --ui
```

if it does not work, you will have to update the selectors by yourself. You can do this easily by running :
```bash
npx playwright codegen https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/jobs\?refinementList%5Boffices.country_code%5D%5B%5D\=FR\&query\=react%20js\&page\=1
```
 by running this command you will be able to select with ease the right selector.
 You just have to understand what the code does, but it is quite easy.

For exemple, the scrapper of welcome to the jungle is located in the backend part "/app/wttjgl/main.js"

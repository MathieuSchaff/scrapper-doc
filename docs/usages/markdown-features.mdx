# Job Scraper App Configuration

This repository contains the configuration file for the Job Scraper app. The configuration options allow you to customize various settings for different job platforms.
## How to launch the scrapper?

Simple type the command at the root of the scrapper backend(but configure it before, see below):

```shell
npm start
```

## How it works ?

The configuration is a simple javascript object located in the 
`/config/config.ts`
## Common Configuration

The common configuration applies to all scrapers and includes the following properties:

- `jobSearch`: The keyword for the job search.
- `location`: The desired job location.
- `numOfPages`: The number of pages to scrape for each job platform.


## Welcome to the Jungle Configuration
 To be able to scrap jobs on welcome to the jungle, you need to configure :
```typescript
 interface WelcomeToTheJungleConfig {
  account?: {
    email: string;
    password: string;
  };
  filters?: {
    contractType?: WTTJGLContractType | number[];
    remote?: string;
    experienceLevel?: WTTJGLExperience;
  };
}
```
setting the account obj is not recommended.
Just set the filters if you want to filter the jobs by:
- contrat type
- remote or not
- experience level

  1 - contractType type :

```typescript
 WTTJGLContractType | number[];
 ```

```typescript
 type WTTJGLContractType =
  | "Permanent contract"
  | "Work-study"
  | "Internship"
  | "Fixed-term / Temporary"
  | "Other"
  | "Freelance"
  | "all"
  | 1
  | 2
  | 3
  | 4
  | 5
  | 6;
```
You can set an array of number: the 1 correspond to the permanent contrat and so on. 


For exemple contractType: [6,1, 4] if you want jobs from different type of contract.

 2 - remote type:
  is a string than can be either :
  ```typescript
no
punctual
partial
fulltime
  ```
  3 - experienceLevel type:

```typescript 
type WTTJGLExperience = Array<0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4>;
```
`experienceLevel`: The experience you want to choose 
    Can be a number from 0 to 4. Or an array of number.
    Each number correspond to :
   0: 0 to 1 year exp
   1: 1 to 3 year exp
   2: 3 to 5 year exp
   4: 5 to 10 year exp

You can also pass an array of number for contractType
